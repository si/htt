  http://www.sixapart.com/log/2005/01/support_for_nof.shtml

v0.35b | 04.11.16
- combined v0.3b and v0.34b into a stand-alone package (Don't roll your eyes at 
  me--it's freeware.)
- Removed those `die` horribly statements that everyone is always raving about ;)
- Made absolutely certain that all associative indexes in arrays were quoted
- Corrected some spelling errors in languages.php (between v0.34b and v0.35b)
- Trimmed newlines before inserting ip-to-country data (based on suggestion from
  Vincent Grouls <http://vincentg.sytes.net/>)

v0.34b | 04.06.27
- Updated language to display human readable language/country pairs instead of
  obscure browser abbreviations (will need to update languages.php occasionally)

v0.33b | 04.06.27
- Displays the past seven days total hits
- Configurable option to condense browser versions into a single percentage (plan 
  to expand on this feature later)
- Referrers now have a title attribute containing the resource they most recently 
  linked to (and vice versa)
- The site's root directory now has a configurable display property (displayed 
  "/" previously) for use in referrer and resource lists
- Added configurable site name for the `<title>` and `<h1>` on the display page
- Added a redirect to the site home page if ShortStat is accessed from an external 
  link (to deter referrer spammers)

  hits received before the current month (done manually for now)

v0.3b | 03.09.04
