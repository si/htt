    <h1>Award Winning Hitting the Target</h1>
    <h2>Learning angles through sports</h2>

	  <h2>Further Information</h2>
<p>Hitting the Target is designed to assist youngsters 
              with understanding angles. It is mainly aimed at the Key Stage 2 
              element of education, where the the concept of angles are introduced 
              in mathematics.</p>
            <p>Hitting the Target aims to address the topic using a subject that 
              all children can relate to - sports. Angles can be applied to virtually 
              any sport, particularly snooker, football, cricket and tennis (the 
              sports used in Hitting the Target).</p>
            <p>The main topics that Hitting the Target cover are:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>calculating and measuring angles</li>
              <li>recognising familiar types of angles</li>
              <li>recognising right-angles</li>
              <li>how to recognise acute and obtuse angles</li>
            </ul>
            <p>If you require further information about Hitting the Target, you 
              can contact the developer Simon Jobling (email [at] hittingthetarget [dot] com). </p>
